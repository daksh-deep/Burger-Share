## Deployment Strategy

### Render.com Auto Spin-down Solution
When deploying web applications on Render.com's free tier, services automatically spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity. This can lead to undesirable delays for end-users as the application needs to restart upon receiving new requests.

To ensure continuous uptime, we've implemented a "Keep-Alive Feedback Loop" using two applications:

| Application | Purpose | Repository |
|------------|----------|------------|
| Burger Share (This repo) | Main file sharing application | [View Code](https://github.com/daksh-deep/burger-share) |
| Keep-Alive API | Uptime maintenance service | [View Code](https://github.com/daksh-deep/keepalive-api) |

#### System Architecture
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Burger Share] -->|Health Check| B[KeepAlive API]
    B -->|Health Check| A
```

The Keep-Alive API sends a request to our application every 10 minutes, and our application responds with a reciprocal health check, creating a continuous feedback loop that keeps both services active.

### Deployment Setup

1. **Deploy Burger Share**
   - Deploy to Render.com
   - Set environment variables:
     ```env
     PORT = 5000
     JWT_SECRET = "your-jwt-secret-key"
     LOG_FILE = './logs/logs.log'
     CLEAN_DIR_PATH = "./uploads"
     KEEP_ALIVE_URL= https://your-keepalive-api.onrender.com/health
     ```

2. **Deploy Keep-Alive API**
   - Clone and deploy the [Keep-Alive API](https://github.com/daksh-deep/keepalive-api) to a different Render account
   - Set the `KEEP_ALIVE_URL` to Burger Share's URL `(/health route)`

This setup ensures both applications remain active and responsive 24/7 without incurring additional costs.

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Token Generation | JWT with file metadata |
| Token Expiration | Configurable timeframe |
| Access Control | Directory isolation |

### System Security

| Measure | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Encryption | Files are encrypted during transmission using HTTPS, and Multer can be configured to handle encrypted storage or secure processing before saving.  |
| Automatic Cleanup | Removal of expired content |
| Error Handling | Comprehensive error handling with a custom logging module for detailed error capture and tracking |
| Secure File Names | Randomized file naming |

## Development & Production

### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Mode
```bash
npm run app
```

## Maintenance
### Monitoring Points

- System logs in `./logs/`
- Render logs
- Storage directory size
- Token expiration processes
- Keep-alive system status
